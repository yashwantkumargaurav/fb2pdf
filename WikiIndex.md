# Introduction #

The goal is to develop a command line utility and web service which allows to convert books in popular FB2 format to PDF.

PDF will be formatted for Sony Reader (Libre) and potentially for other devices.

Main idea is to use TeX to create nicely looking PDF files with word breaks, etc.
